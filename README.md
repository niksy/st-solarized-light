# Solarized Light color scheme for Sublime Text

This repository contains my personal changes to the fork of [Solarized Light color scheme for Sublime Text](https://github.com/SublimeColors/Solarized).

Some of the changes are:

* Improved text selection background
* Improved BracketHighlighter highlighting
* Additional highlighting for specific parts such as CSS `!important`, JS functions and `console` and HTML embeddable parts
* Improved display of find results window
* Additions for sytanxes such as Apache config files
